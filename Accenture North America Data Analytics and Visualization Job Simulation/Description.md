## Task 1: Project Understanding

A data analyst sits between the business and the data.
* You are working as a Data Analyst at Accenture.
* Your team has been assigned a new project for a client called Social Buzz.
* One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz. She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project. Mae has shared the project brief so you can get up to speed on what Social Buzz need help with.

## Task 2: Data Cleaning & Modeling

* You have been sent 7 datasets and a data model. Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
* So, the first step is to use this data model-- to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
* As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
* We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
* So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.

#### Data Cleaning
Clean the data by:
* removing rows that have values which are missing,
* changing the data type of some values within a column, and
* removing columns which are not relevant to this task.
            - Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

Your end result should be three cleaned data sets:
* 
* 
* 

#### Data Modelling
* Create a final data set by merging your three tables together
* Figure out the Top 5 performing categories
* The end result should be one spreadsheet which contains:
     - A cleaned dataset
     - The top 5 categories

#### Cleaned Dataset
Here is the cleaned data set:


## Task 3: Data Visualization & Storytelling

    - Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
    - The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
