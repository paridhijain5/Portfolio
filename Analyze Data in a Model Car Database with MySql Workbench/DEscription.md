# Analyze Data in a Model Car Database with MySql Workbench (on Coursera)

## The Project Scenario

### Overview:
In this project, you will step into the shoes of an entry-level data analyst at the fictional Mint Classics Company, helping to analyze data in a relational database with the goal of supporting inventory-related business decisions that lead to the closure of a storage facility.

### Project Scenario:

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of their storage facilities. 

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers. For example, they would like to be able to ship a product to a customer within 24 hours of the order being placed.

As a data analyst, you have been asked to use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data. You will be provided with a data model and sample data tables to review. You will then need to isolate and identify those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory. You will write queries to answer questions like these:
1) Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
2) How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3) Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

The answers to questions like those should help you to formulate suggestions and recommendations for reducing inventory with the goal of closing one of the storage facilities. 

### Project Objectives:

1. Explore products currently in inventory.
2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

### Your Challenge:

Your challenge will be to conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities. To do this, you will import the database and then analyze data. You will also pose questions, and seek to answer them meaningfully using SQL queries to retrieve data from the database provided.

In this project, we'll use the fictional Mint Classics relational database and a relational data model. Both will be provided.


## Build Your Project

You will be using MySQL Workbench outside of Coursera -  in your own environment. Before beginning the project, you must have MySQL Workbench installed, configured, launched and connected to a local MySQL server instance. 

For your reference and use in analysis, the EER (Extended Entity-Relationship) diagram that models the structure of the Mint Classics database is provided here.

### Check Your Work
Here's a checklist for generating an exceptional SQL-based data analysis project:

1. **Database Import:** The learner should demonstrate the ability to import a database using an SQL script.
        * The working database should include all sample tables, relationships, and data.
        * The database should match the  EER (Extended Entity-Relationship diagram) provided.

2. **Data Understanding:** The learner should demonstrate a deep understanding of the data and the problem being explored. The following should be included:
        * A clear description of the the data as it relates to inventory-related business processes
        * Evidence, in the form of SQL scripts, of a detailed exploration of the data, including summary statistics
        * Any explanation of unknown variables that could affect the validity of the data analysis

3. **Analysis Techniques:** The learner should use a variety of appropriate analysis techniques to explore the data and draw insights. The following should be included:
        * A clear explanation of the analysis techniques used and why they were chosen
        * Appropriate statistical tests, models, and algorithms to analyze the data
        * Thoughtful consideration of the limitations and assumptions of the analysis techniques used 

4. **Insights and Conclusions:** The learner should draw insightful conclusions from the database development process and communicate those conclusions. The following should be included:
        * Clear and well-supported conclusions that provide meaningful insights into the problem being explored
        * Appropriate recommendations or next steps based on the analysis
        * A collection of SQL scripts and results supporting  those recommendations
        * A clear explanation of any limitations or areas for further research


## Results

**SQL Scripts:**
* [EDA]()
* [Business Questions]
