# Churn Prediction Model

### Project Description

This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict customer churn using historical data from a telecommunications company. Customer churn, the rate at which customers stop doing business with a company, is a critical metric for businesses, especially in competitive industries. By predicting which customers are at risk of leaving, companies can take proactive measures to improve customer retention and loyalty.


### Objectives

* Predict Customer Churn: Develop a machine learning model to accurately predict whether a customer will churn.
* Identify Key Factors: Analyze the data to identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn.
* Provide Actionable Insights: Offer recommendations to the business on how to reduce churn based on the model's findings.


### Data Source
The dataset used for this project is the [Telco Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn) from kaggle, which includes information on customer demographics, account information, and services used.


### Project Steps

* Data Collection: Import and load the dataset.
* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore and visualize the data to understand the distributions and relationships between features.
* Feature Engineering: Create new features that might help improve the model's performance.
* Model Training: Train a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) to predict customer churn.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC AUC score.
* Model Interpretation: Interpret the model to understand the factors contributing to customer churn.
* Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarize the findings and provide recommendations to the business.


### Insights

* Key factors influencing churn include TotalCharges, MonthlyCharges, Tenure, and Contract.
* Customers with higher charges and shorter contract terms are more likely to churn.
* Longer tenure generally reduces the likelihood of churn.


### Conclusion

The churn prediction model offers valuable insights into customer behavior, enabling businesses to implement targeted strategies for reducing churn. Regular updates to the model and continuous customer feedback are essential for maintaining its effectiveness.
